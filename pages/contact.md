## Contact

In my efforts, I do my best in reaching out to designers and other collaborators of the games I document â€“ to ask for permission. I similarly do my best in providing accurate descriptions to the games represented. I believe, whenever possible, it is important to give creators the right of refusal if they do not wish their work to be visible in this way. You may request the removal of the material from this site by contacting me by email. Or if you wish any descriptions to be modified for any reason, you are also welcome to contact me. Upon receiving an email that includes the game in question, the record will be promptly removed or edited.

Am I missing a game that you created that you would like added? Would you like to chat about this project? 

My email is aubreykobayashi@gmail.com
